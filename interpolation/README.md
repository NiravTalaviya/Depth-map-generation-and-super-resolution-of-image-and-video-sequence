# Interpolation

- **interpolation.ipynb**:
    - contains implemenation for nearest neighbour, linear, and bicubic interpolation. Each code snippet has been titled accordingly

- **bspline_experiment.ipynb**
    - Contains implementation for spline interpolation. It also contains code for intuition behind B-spline.

- **apply_to_imagenet.ipynb**
    - For each interpolation method, super resolution factor of 2, 4, and 8 is applied on Imagenet dataset.

- **apply_to_Set14.ipynb**
    - For each interpolation method, super resolution factor of 2, 4, and 8 is applied on Set14 dataset.
